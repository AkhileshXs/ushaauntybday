            <p>Dear Usha Aunty,<br>
                Wishing you a very happy birthday! You have always filled our lives with love, warmth, and of course… super healthy food! 🥗😂 We all know there’s no escaping your "this is good for you" advice, even when we just want cake. 🍰😆

But honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. You make everything special, and we are so lucky to have you. Hope your day is full of love, laughter, and maybe—just maybe—a little extra dessert today! 😉💖
